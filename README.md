# project-edits-viewer

Implement an internal tool with the following features:

1. A form that allows the user to upload a CSV file. The CSV will contain data about code edits to various projects.

2. When the CSV is uploaded, parse the data and filter to only include rows where the "type" column equals "ai_update". 

3. Extract the project ID from each row. The project ID is the first ID in the "__path__" column.

4. Display a dropdown menu populated with the unique project IDs extracted in step 3. 

5. When the user selects a project ID from the dropdown:
   - Filter the data to only include rows for the selected project
   - Display the filtered rows in a list, sorted by the "__created__" column
   - For each row, show:
     - The content from the "tags.output" column, pretty printed
     - The "commit_sha" value, but only if the "status" column is not "failed"

Use Chakra UI components for the layout and styling. Let me know if you have any questions!
